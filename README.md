## Design Choices for POS System Frontend

### 1. Dark Mode
- The app uses a dark background with bright buttons to make it easy on the eyes. It also gives the app a modern and professional look.

### 2. Order List with Status
- The order list shows the customerâ€™s name, table number, and how many items they ordered. Color-coded labels like "Ready to Serve" (green) and "Waiting" (yellow) help staff quickly see the order status.

### 3. Easy Menu Navigation
- There are tabs for **Food** and **Snack** at the top, making it simple to switch between categories. This design is user-friendly and fits well with the dark theme.

### 4. Clear Menu Cards
- Each menu item shows a picture, name, calories, rating, and price. The "Add" button is easy to find and use, so staff can quickly add items to the cart.

### 5. Action Bar at the Bottom
- A green button at the bottom shows the total price and allows users to "Proceed Transaction." This makes it easy to complete the order no matter where they are on the page.
